/**
 * This app's boot-time signing identity (refs imajin-ai#2411, ruled b by
 * Ryan 2026-09-27 — see imajin-ai#2413).
 *
 * `apps.provision` (kernel-side) mints this app's own Ed25519 keypair in the
 * vault and grants it to the app's own DID; this app never holds that key
 * in an env file. `@ima-jin/auth-client`'s `loadAppSigningKey()` fetches it
 * at boot instead: a one-time claim code redeems it on first boot, and a
 * locally persisted bootstrap keypair (never the signing key itself)
 * re-authenticates every later boot. See docs/REGISTRATION.md.
 *
 * Memory-only: the signing key returned here is cached in process memory
 * (on `globalThis`, see `SIGNING_IDENTITY_KEY` below) and never written to disk, another env var, or a log
 * line — only `loadAppSigningKey()`'s own narrow-purpose bootstrap keystore
 * file touches disk.
 *
 * Unclaimed boot mode (imajin-ai#2427): when neither a bootstrap keystore
 * nor `IMAJIN_APP_CLAIM_CODE` is present yet, `bootstrapSigningIdentity()`
 * returns without throwing instead of crashing boot — `middleware.ts`
 * serves a minimal "not claimed yet" page until an operator pastes a claim
 * code at `/claim` (`app/claim/page.tsx`, `app/api/claim/route.ts`, both of
 * which call `claimWithCode()` below). A *real* failure — a claim code that
 * IS provided but the kernel refuses, a network error, … — still throws.
